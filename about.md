      Hi, I'm Joonseo, a passionate developer with a background in computer science. I specialize in creating web applications and have experience in programming languages including Python and C++. I enjoy cooperative problem-solving and constantly strive to improve my skills and adopt new technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new places, reading tech blogs, or playing video games.

      Throughout my education, I had numerous opportunities to engage with people from various backgrounds in a diverse learning environment. This fascinated me with different worlds and broadened my perspective. I recognized the profound connection between the ubiquity of computer science and our lifestyle. As a future developer, I aim to create projects that emphasize the interconnectedness between humans, computers, and AI technologies, making these tools more accessible and personalized for every community.
